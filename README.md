# **ELT Project with dbt and Snowflake**  
This mini-project uses **Snowflake as the data warehouse** to store retail shop data. The **EL (Extract-Load)** process covers data ingestion into Snowflake.

For the **T (Transform)** stage, **dbt (data build tool)** handles all transformations, making the data ready for analysis in a BI tool.
